# RPS(Rock-Paper-Scissors) Game

‚ÄúRock paper scissors‚Äù is a simple and interesting
game. Many of us used to play it in a school to
resolve disputes or just to spend some time.
This version is inspired by "Street-Figth theme".
Where one character represents player and other the AI.

The rules are very simple and probably you remember them from your childhood:

    If you choose Rock, you will win against Scissors but lose against Paper.
    If you choose Scissors, you will win against Paper but lose against Rock.
    If you choose Paper, you will win against Rock but lose against Scissors.
